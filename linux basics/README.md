**!!NB**
with most command line tools you will come across `FLAGS` and `ARGUMENTS`.

## FLAGS - AKA: keywords.
**they tell the progam what function or action you want to perform.**
    
## ARGUMENTS - AKA: required input.
**they are the pieces of data/infomation the program needs to complete an action/task.** 
    
To learn more about FLAGS and ARGUMENTS, use the {man} progam + progarm you wish to use , program you wish to use + {-h/--help} flag , program you wish to us without any commands search for it online.

there are some command line tools that only accept arguments.
