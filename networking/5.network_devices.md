## essential components in computer networks that facilitate communication and data transmission between various devices

**Router** \
    : Connects different networks and directs data packets between them.

**Switch** \
    : Connects devices within a LAN and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

**Hub** \
    : A basic device that connects multiple Ethernet devices, making them act as a single network segment.

**Modem** \
    : Modulates and demodulates signals for data transmission over telephone lines or cable systems.

**Network Interface Card (NIC)** \
    : A hardware component installed in a computer or device, allowing it to connect to a network.

**firewal** \
    : network security device that establishes a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, filtering traffic by examining data packets and enforcing security policies.
