# A network topology 
## refers to the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a computer network.
### It defines how devices are connected and how data is transmitted between them.


**Point-to-Point (P2P)** \
    : A direct connection between two nodes, used for simple LAN connections or direct connections between devices.

**Star** \
    : All devices are connected to a central hub.

**Bus** \
    : All devices share a single communication line.

**Ring** \
    : Each device is connected to two others, forming a circular pathway.

**Mesh** \
    : Devices are interconnected, allowing for multiple pathways for data.

**Tree** \
    : A hierarchical structure combining multiple star topologies onto a bus, used in large corporate networks and university campuses.
